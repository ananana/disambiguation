w7_0357477_908 The basic model would cost $80 million and could be outfitted with engines from either General Electric Co. of the U.S. or the Pratt & Whitney division of United Technologies Corp. The MD-11, like the proposed Airbus A340, is aimed at serving long-distance routes that don't attract enough traffic to justify using a 450-seat 747.   
w7_0604850_1558 Judge Robert Bork contended that his views on antitrust law fully consider the interests of consumers, but argued that some forms of antitrust regulation don't promote competition. Referring to his 1978 book on antitrust law, the Supreme Court nominee in his third day of testimony told the Senate Judiciary Committee, "My entire book . . . is premised on the question of what best serves consumers . . . ."   
w7_04318056_1119 "We weren't going anywhere near that price for those magazines," Mr. Singerman says. Instead, News Corp. ended up going after Ziff-Davis's business publications serving the aviation and travel industries, for which it paid about $350 million.   
w7_03711009_971 He noted that American doesn't plan to inaugurate its new hub at Raleigh/Durham until June 15. In choosing between Delta and Pan Am for the route between London and the northeastern U.S., the judge noted that both carriers already serve London.   
w7_06418611_1695 Airport concourses in Cincinnati, Chicago and San Francisco are coming to resemble shopping-mall clusters of eateries, with stands offering tacos, omelettes and freshly-grilled Belgian waffles topped with fruit. Because airport traffic ebbs and flows and many customers are pressed for time, a fast-food format can serve the clientele better than a cafeteria, says Kenneth Smith, vice president of planning and business development of Marriott Corp.'s Host division, which is overhauling its restaurants and bars at 40 airports.   
w7_03314471_858 The merger would link two airlines whose operations are concentrated on their respective coasts and would create the seventh-largest domestic airline in terms of revenue passenger miles, USAir Group said. USAir Group, which is based in Washington, serves 83 airports but only about 12 are west of St. Louis. PSA, based in San Diego, serves 29 airports primarily on the West Coast, five of which already are served by USAir Group.

w7_00711896_173 Although it isn't likely that Japanese exports will ever play a major role in the overall U.S. trade picture, he suggests that "eventually Japanese investment in the U.S. could help revitalize some American export industries." Ricoh's efforts to avoid anti-dumping penalties being levied by the European Economic Community against Japanese-made copiers are part of the company's overall strategy of building factories in markets Ricoh serves.   
w7_00411870_79 The proposed rate increases are aimed at helping the utility pay for costs related to its investment in the Palo Verde nuclear power plant near Phoenix, Ariz.

w7_05312612_1391 The Ford Motor Co. unit, which previously said it planned to increase the number of its branches, said it hopes to continue expanding in the nation's second-largest retailer at that pace over the next several years. While bank deregulation has caused many major banks to abandon serving lower and middle income groups, First Nationwide's chairman, Anthony M. Frank, said at a news conference here that the expansion in retail stores "might be the way you solve the problem of serving just plain folks."

w7_03914517_1024 In addition to private buses on fixed routes, there are about 4,500 flexible-route minibuses, most individually owned. These fully deregulated minibus services have proved especially successful at serving sparsely populated districts without subsidy and acting as feeder services for the subway.   
w7_0112673_264 Marc Gregoire, the marketing director for the 737 program, said 10 other airlines are in "serious" discussions about possible purchases of the new 737 version. Boeing Commercial Airplane Co., Seattle-based Boeing's commercial aircraft arm, has been canvassing airlines for at least a year about such a plane, and its decision to proceed with construction appears to be a move to dominate -- with a thoroughly updated design -- the market for planes with 100 to 130 seats, which is served by such competitors as Fokker N.V., a Dutch concern, and British Aerospace.   
w7_0049509_76 Not long ago, locals hunted crocodiles for cash to supplement their subsistence living. Today, most river people find it more profitable and much easier to serve the art and artifacts market than to face crocs at night on an unforgiving river.

w7_00614523_146 Not being able to supply equipment to Tokyo, Nagoya and eastern Japan "provides us very little opportunity to sell," says Stephen L. Levy, Motorola's executive vice president in charge of Japan. Daini Denden's, and thus Motorola's, failure to win the right to serve the entire Japanese market has made American officials here cynical.   
w7_0419844_1062 Brock Hotel Corp. said 34% of its shareholders who own 10 or fewer common shares had tendered their holdings when its small-lot offer expired yesterday.

w7_0422990_1077 This was accomplished jointly, by management's increasingly efficient use of labor, and a performance by our mail handlers and carriers that reaffirmed their commitment to provide our customers with the quality service they deserve. The problems raised by Mr. Bovard will not be solved by slashing the wages of dedicated postal employees, nor will the public be served by the privatization of its Postal Service.

w7_0457389_1167 Wall Street sources predict that of all the big banks that have applied for this power, Bankers Trust New York and J.P. Morgan probably will achieve the most success, mainly because of the inroads they have made already as agents. Indeed, these sources point out that success in this business may be most crucial for those two banks, because both of them have concentrated their efforts on serving the biggest corporations, which have abandoned bank financing for commercial paper.   
w7_0726673_1875 The plan estimates that if everything went as hoped, the system might be able to get by without drawing any federal money at all, particularly in early years -- a potentially important point in the face of current congressional budget-cutting requirements. "The system doesn't need a cash infusion so long as it has market borrowing access, capital to absorb losses and the ability to serve farmer-borrowers on a basis that is both reasonable to them and profitable for FCS over the long term," the proposal asserts.   
w7_06918214_1809 A majority of the 200 or so attacks on shipping since the war began have been conducted by Iran. Ships serving Kuwaiti ports are the main target.

w7_0611857_1583 Since 1985, the Japanese yen has appreciated substantially compared with the U.S. dollar, making it relatively less expensive for the Japanese to build vehicles in the U.S. David Healy, analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., estimates that it now costs the Japanese about as much to build their vehicles in Japan and ship them to the U.S. as it does to build them here. Honda is also keenly aware of growing protectionist sentiment in Congress and has repeatedly stated its goal to build vehicles in the markets it serves.
