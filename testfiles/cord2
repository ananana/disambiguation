art} aphb 07800664: Little knots of men swarmed over each boat , taking off the canvas covers , clearing the masts and useless paraphernalia , putting in lanterns and tins of biscuits . Other men stood at the davits , fitting in cranks and uncoiling the lines .
art} aphb 07800667: The davits creaked , the pulleys squealed , and the boats slowly swung out free of the ship . Next , a few feet of line were paid out , so that each boat would lie flush with the Boat Deck ... or , in some cases , flush with Promenade Deck A directly below .
art} aphb 07801528: Then he realized he needn't try any longer the boat was floating off . He jumped in ... cut the stern lines ... yelled for someone to free the bow ... and in the next instant was washed out by the same wave that swept off Peter Daly .

" There was a different kind of trouble in Boat 6 . Friction erupted from the moment Major Peuchen slid down the line to fill out the crew .

art} aphb 07802478: Hugh Woolner shouted as 14 sailed up . Lowe tossed over a line and gave them a tow .
art} aphb 08303349: He could feel the cage move as it strained against the lashings at each roll . What he could not see was how the constant working of the cage was wearing the line thin where it was tied to the railing . A big sea , a heavy roll , and the line finally parted . With the next roll the cage slid a foot , then was stopped by the slackening line . On the following roll the cage slid back a foot and Ben's great weight behind it shot the cage forward and snapped the remaining lines .
art} aphb 08303361: The boat rolled again , and the cage slid away from the winch . The men ran with lines , shouting , trying to get the lines around the cage to snub it tight against the rail . Before they could tighten their lines , the cage jerked free , shot across the deck , and struck the winch a mighty timber-shattering blow that caved in one side of the cage .
art} aphb 08502144: All animal life was new and full of wonder for Jim as much as for Chet , and he longed to see a fish , to touch its scaly sides , to examine its gills . But when ten minutes had passed without a nibble on Chet's line , Jim started to give up hope .
art} aphb 08502160: Jim ran to his father , who was studying the ice near the edge of the water , and called , " Ted's got London on the radio , Dad ! " They gathered around all but Chet , who went on dangling his line stolidly as though the entire success of their journey depended on his luck as a fisherman .
art} aphb 08502223: Chet ignored the banter . He peered into the dark water as though trying to hocus fish onto his line with sheer will power .

art} aphb 08800556: We name the group Triplet Falls . We make a portage around the first ; past the second and third we let down with lines .
art} aphb 08800567: At such a place , we are letting down the last boat , and , as she is set free , a wave turns her broadside down the stream , with the stem , to which the line is attached , from shore , and a little up . They haul on the line to bring the boat in , but the power of the current , striking obliquely against her , shoots her out into the middle of the river .
art} aphb 08800568: They haul on the line to bring the boat in , but the power of the current , striking obliquely against her , shoots her out into the middle of the river . The men have their hands burned with the friction of the passing line ; the boat breaks away , and speeds , with great velocity , down the stream .
art} aphb 08800696: On examination , I find a horizontal crevice in the rock , about ten feet above the water , and a boat's length below us , so we let her down to that point . One of the men clambers into the crevice , in which he can just crawl ; we toss him the line , which he makes fast in the rocks , and now our boat is tied up .
art} aphb 08800716: June 22 . Still making short portages and letting down with lines .
art} aphb 08800755: We run two or three rapids after they have been carefully examined . Then we have a series of six or eight , over which we are compelled to pass by letting the boats down with lines .
art} aphb 08800764: This afternoon , we find three falls in close succession . We carry our rations over the rocks , and let our boats shoot over the falls , checking and bringing them to land with lines in the eddies below .
art} aphb 08800880: Our run today is through a canyon , with ragged , broken walls , many lateral gulches or canyons entering on either side . The river is rough , and occasionally it becomes necessary to use lines in passing rocky places .
art} aphb 08800933: To us who are below , it seems impossible to keep the boat from going under the overhanging cliff ; but Powell , for the moment , heedless of Bradley's mishap , pulls with all his power for half a dozen strokes , when the danger is past ; then he seizes Bradley , and pulls him in . The men in the boat above , seeing this , land , and she is let down by lines .
art} aphb 08800942: Held in this way , the men are able to pull her into a cove , in the left wall , where she is made fast . But this leaves a man on the rock above , holding to the line of the little boat .
art} aphb 08800943: But this leaves a man on the rock above , holding to the line of the little boat . When all is ready , he springs from the rock , clinging to the line with one hand , and swimming with the other , and we pull him in as he goes by .
art} aphb 08801190: In one , the " Emma Dean " is caught in a whirlpool , and set spinning about ; and it is with great difficulty we are able to get out of it , with the loss of an oar . At noon , another is made ; and on we go , running some of the rapids , letting down with lines past others , and making two short portages .
art} aphb 08801420: Then we let down another boat to the end of its line beyond the first , and the third boat to the end of its line below the second , which brings it to the head of the fall , and under an overhanging rock . Then the upper boat , in obedience to a signal , lets go ; we pull in the line , and catch the nearest boat as it comes , and then the last .
art} aphb 08801529: Then we go , gliding by hills and ledges , with distant walls in view ; sweeping past sharp angles of rock ; stopping at a few points to examine rapids , which we find can be run , until we have made another five miles , when we land for dinner . Then we let down with lines , over a long rapid , and start again .
art} aphb 08801570: We land at its mouth , and stop for an hour or two to examine the fall . It seems possible to let down with lines , at least a part of the way , from point to point , along the right-hand wall .
art} aphb 08801576: On the shore of this little eddy there is about two feet of gravel beach above the water . Standing on this beach , some of the men take the line of the little boat and let it drift down against another projecting angle . Here is a little shelf , on which a man from my boat climbs , and a shorter line is passed to him , and he fastens the boat to the side of the cliff . Then the second one is let down , bringing the line of the third .
art} aphb 08801703: In this way , curious little alcoves are formed , in which are quiet bays of water , but on a much smaller scale than the great bays and buttresses of Marble Canyon . The river is still rapid , and we stop to let down with lines several times , but make greater progress as we run ten miles .
art} aphb 08801824: It is with no little misgiving that we see the river enter these black , hard walls . At its very entrance we have to make a portage ; then we have to let down with lines past some ugly rocks .
art} aphb 08801834: Finding I am caught here , suspended 400 feet above the river , into which I should fall if my footing fails , I call for help . The men come , and pass me a line , but I cannot let go of the rock long enough to take hold of it .
art} aphb 08801912: We can climb it , and walk along its summit to a point where we are just at the head of the fall . Here the basalt is broken down again , so it seems to us , and I direct the men to take a line to the top of the cliff , and let the boats down along the wall . One man remains in the boat , to keep her clear of the rocks , and prevent her line from being caught on the projecting angles .
art} aphb 08801918: She is in swift water , and they are not able to pull her back ; nor are they able to go on with the line , as it is not long enough to reach the higher part of the cliff , which is just before them ; so they take a bight around a crag . I send two men back for the other line .
art} aphb 08801923: I stand on a projecting rock , waving my hat to gain his attention , for my voice is drowned by the roaring of the falls . Just at this moment , I see him take his knife from its sheath , and step forward to cut the line .
art} aphb 08801935: But he is in a whirlpool . We have the stem-post of his boat attached to the line .

art} aphb 13500813: But if anything happened to you , they could use you for seed . " The Soldier now returned with a long line and tied all three firmly together , also lashing them to the body of the Saw-Horse ; so there seemed little danger of their tumbling off . "

art} aphb 14301943: At all other times they carefully avoid our hens , even to the point as has been often the case of walking right through a cluster of them , looking as smugly self-righteous as you could imagine .

The tightly stretched line served as a horizontal bar ; it had just enough spring to allow the contestants to combine their strength , nimbleness , and sense of timing into an astonishing array of acrobatic tricks .
art} aphb 14902119: Fastened securely to the pin is a barbless hook similar to a fisherman's gaff . Throwing the pin-like float , with rawhide line attached , over and beyond the dead animal , the hunter drags it back across his prize , snagging it with the sharp hook .

art} aphb 17502535: Most divers in island waters carry a long line on which to string their catch . The end of this line is tied to an empty plastic bleach bottle , which serves as a buoy to keep the line floating so the diver can tow his catch a safe distance behind .
art} aphb 17502537: Any hungry shark following will come after the fish , not the diver . The length of the line protects a diver by giving him time to see an approaching shark and swim away .

Lines had been stretched between the limbs of the four great pasania trees by the kitchen , and wash now took up every inch of the linen cords that webbed the trees together . Maggie , tied beneath the lines , kept running back and forth under the white shapes sportively flapping over her head and every once in a while let out a prolonged howl . When the wash was hung , Etsuko walked around between the lines .
