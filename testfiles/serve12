w7_04814377_1252 Most part-time legislators believe that they won't be reelected if they don't pass at least three or four bills every session. Mr. Ledbetter, who served five terms in the Arkansas Legislature, calls it a trade-off.

w7_0446244_1140 The president cannot expect to carry out his policy if he isn't elected, and he cannot get elected without a policy that appeals to the electorate. (In my own view, the importance of an arms-control agreement to the achievement of wide-based popular support for any administration has been massively exaggerated, but it is undeniable that such a connection has existed in the minds and calculations of senior administration officials.) Those who serve on the NSC staff are expected to reflect an understanding of this interaction between domestic political imperatives and national-security objectives.

w7_01711574_422 What upsets Congress more than the diversion of funds is the administration's decision to use private citizens, including foreign agents and arms merchants, to carry out secret foreign initiatives without consulting Congress.

w7_05916679_1550 Since there are nine members of the court, one seat would become vacant every two years, assuring each president the right to appoint, with Senate approval, two justices (four if the president were reelected). Whenever a justice, for whatever reason, failed to complete his term, the president would name a successor, but that successor would serve only the unexpired portion of the term for which his predecessor had been appointed.
