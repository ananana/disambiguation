aphb_27802308_1769 The following are generally accepted, but should be checked with local sources in case there may be regional variations. They serve as the most important wedding anniversary themes and can be used, in many cases, as sources of ideas for gifts.

w7_02418601_598 Frankie, an "image consultant," meets them both after she's hired to sell the idea of sending Ulysses on a space mission to the public. Either because of the way the scientist's part is written, or the way Mr. Malkovich plays it, or both, Dr. Peters is too much of an airheaded Caspar Milquetoast to be a plausible villain, too insubstantial to serve as a satirical vision of the "perfectly" unemotional man.   
aphb_43801008_3153 Most psychiatrists who get Government referrals are cautious men themselves, respectable practitioners. Now if you can provide any instance, any occurrence, that might serve as real evidence; but mere suspicions won't do.   
aphb_37601884_2696 The human bitch is something else again. In many cultures dogs serve as scavengers; and they certainly lead a miserable-looking existence, kicked by every passing human, half-starved and " wolfing " every possible bit of food they can find.

aphb_47102811_3326 Otherwise, to ask such questions is a breach of professional courtesy and a violation of good corporate manners. What directors really do, according to Professor Mace, is to give advice and counsel when asked, and, by the mere fact of their presence, serve as a discipline for presidents and subordinate management.   
aphb_01300461_82 " It's a table , and after Goldilocks and Sue are dressed they're going to have tea . " She casually indicated two dolls lying patiently naked on the floor while she selected clothing for them from a box which served as a dolls' wardrobe .

w7_02110670_513 In part to defuse criticism over an expensive tomb being built for the Suharto family near Solo, central Java, the government in 1978 turned Sukarno's grave into a stone shrine. A Balinese-style gate serves as the entrance to a small park in the center of Blitar.

aphb_47200289_3328 In addition, Olin has been expanding into new lines of business. Towey says that the recent acquisition of three home-construction companies should serve as countercyclical bolsters to the company's capital-intensive product lines.   
aphb_35400868_2191 Arthur gave him the prescribed dose of chloral, a strong sedative, and his patient finally dropped off into a deep sleep. Leaving a low flame in a hurricane lamp to serve as a night light, he retired to the next room.   
w7_0354628_900 Nothing in the California law forbids commercial use of ethnic languages in stores, in the media or in any way deemed useful. However, the law does seem to suggest that no action for which the government is responsible should serve as a disincentive to learning English; not in the documents that it issues, not in its activities nor in its attitude.

Among the first books they made for Tahmasp was a beautiful manuscript of Nizami's Khamsa, containing an illustration that might serve as a picture of the young shah and his court.   
w7_01615768_395 After several years of pledging never to yield to terrorists, he shipped arms to hated Iran, in part as ransom for hostages. The problem was less the policy, which also sought to serve geopolitical purposes, than the disparity between action and rhetoric.

aphb_19800616_1249 The simplest method of divination is by means of omens, watching out for nature's signs and symbols the stubbing of a toe, the crowing of a rooster, the hooting of an owl, the singing of a cricket, the flight of birds, wreaths of smoke, clouds, and so on. Birds and animals and natural phenomena are good sources of information, not because they themselves know anything but because they serve as guideposts to the future.   
w7_0189822_443 "You go into court alone to argue some really insignificant motion on a case and 30 lawyers show up for the other side," says Daniel Childs, a Philadelphia lawyer who is handling two smokers' cases.

w7_00410169_77 Some leaders, particularly powerful Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, clearly are flirting with America. They are self-confident enough now to deal with the "great Satan," and seem to want at least some kind of relationship with the U.S. to acquire arms and to serve as a counterweight to the Soviet colossus on Iran's northern border.   
w7_0062355_123 The superpowers may be narrowing their differences, but Europe's rejoicing is curiously muted. While it raises hopes, Mr. Gorbachev's proposal also serves as a reminder that Europe remains the place where more nuclear weapons are targeted than anyplace else.   
w7_02110990_514 The government further ensures domestic placidity by running the nation's single television station, with some of the dullest programming in Asia, and periodically shutting down local newspapers. Still, election time allows more freedom of expression than usual, and serves a national temperature-taking function.   
aphb_50503615_3561 The remaining wines from the Vaud and Neuchatel cantons usually bear the name of their village or the grape e.g. Gamay (grape) for the red wine made in the Vaud, or Dezaley, a mountain slope in the Lavaux area; the most famous of Neuchatel calls its rose " Oeil de Perdrix " (partridge eye), a name used in some French wine districts. A complete list of the names of Swiss wines would serve no purpose, even if it could be established, for many are made in such small quantities that they enjoy no more than a local reputation.   
aphb_54900997_4396 Lord Baltimore authorized the coining of shillings, sixpence, and groats, which were backed by tobacco. Because of the widespread local acceptance of the currency, many economic worries were averted (although tobacco itself had to serve for many years as the medium of exchange in international trade).   
w7_07412046_1914 They are yet another way Congress has found to supply money to constituencies, and interfere with the proper workings of trade and credit markets, in ways that are less obvious than some of its other activities. Where it will all lead, we don't know, but it certainly would be a great thing if Congress would someday start asking itself how many activities it is subsidizing and what purpose the subsidies serve.

aphb_48700131_3440 The professor was referring, of course, to Chinese calligraphy, yet by the same token, for the concrete poet, the beauty of his work lies in its patent manifestation.

aphb_13801633_909 This is answered , in choruses 7 and 8 , by Armstrong's comparatively angular and frenetic solo . A more extended repetition of chorus 3 serves as coda ; the equilibrium here achieved between the close homophony of the ensemble and Dodds's winging clarinet solo is truly consummatory .   
w7_0083622_190 On the other hand, four years does seem a bit too restrictive, too protective of management. A two-year requirement would probably serve the same purpose just as well.

w7_0092053_215 For example, by picturing humans as made in the image of the Creator, Judaism instructed human beings that they have an obligation to imitate the One in whose image they are made: to be creative, to be responsible for changing history by following out the clues written into creation by its intelligent Creator; to be alert to the intelligibility embodied by the Creator within all things; to see all things -- if I may use a Christian phrase for a perception held in common -- as a gift of grace; and to attend both to the responsible individual and to corporate, communal institutions and free associations. Since these intellectual foundations are now the inheritance of all of us, this handbook will be invaluable for teachers of business ethics today, of whatever religious or humanistic framework, for it serves as an intelligent guide to the longest sustained (and concrete) tradition of thinking about commercial activities in the Western world.

aphb_08202537_554 If the antiquity and persistence of a belief were evidence of its validity, few things would be better attested than the existence of witches. Human hands certainly differ greatly, certainly can be expressive; and it may well be that they could serve as an index to personality.   
w7_0725694_1872 In announcing the distribution, for instance, Allegis said it had been considering the move for two months. Analysts wonder why, then, the company ever bothered with the Boeing pact, which now could prove to be extremely expensive for Allegis -- especially since the pact only served as the company's main takeover defense for a period of about two weeks.   
aphb_08202330_552 But Negroes cannot be lumped into any single cultural category : the only defining characteristic , as we use the term in the United States , is evidence of some share of colored ancestry , usually showing in terms of skin color , hair form , or perhaps facial features . Such traits hardly define a way of life ; but they can be and are used as caste marks , serving as identification to the dominant group in enforcing limitations on activity .

aphb_09702423_675 This episode helped to harden party lines in America, identifying the Republican party with support of the French Revolution, while the Federalists leaned towards its enemy, England.

aphb_08201861_547 Robert Lindner (as quoted in the Kronhausens' book) has stated this position well: " As a psychoanalyst who has had more than a decade of experience with the emotionally disturbed, and especially with delinquents, I am convinced of the absurdity of the idea that any form of reading matter, including so-called comics and " other objectionable books, " can either provoke delinquent or criminal behavior or instruct toward such ends...

aphb_23700578_1398 If there really are readers who want this combination of material , which is a publisher's marketing decision , not a reviewer's problem , then this book covers it well .

aphb_26100393_1528 M. Servan-Schreiber's victory does not for the present alter this plain fact. But it does serve as a warning that a lot of people may be growing weary of a government that has lost General de Gaulle's intellectual unorthodoxy and settled into a padded conservatism.   
w7_04611441_1197 The health system is also financed by compulsory payroll deductions (although high-income earners may choose a private plan, and about 8% of the people have).

aphb_20402046_1284 In the bedroom there were two army cots , on one of which lay Will's sports jacket and his sun glasses . Apparently they had served their purpose and Fred did not plan to use them any more .   
aphb_03303398_225 The Coonley House of 1908-1910 at Riverside , Illinois , is a good example of the planning and elevations he worked out to express his beliefs that a house should use contemporary forms , should encourage domesticity , should serve as a shelter for cultivated activities and should accord with the personal needs of the owner . This complex served also as a school run by the Coonleys .   
w7_02414035_591 The Senate Budget Committee's plan makes similar choices, but hasn't yet passed the Senate. The budget resolution, once it is reconciled between the two chambers, is supposed to serve as a guide for budget decisions throughout the year.   
aphb_30703735_1944 The ultimate objective of the class swimmer is utilitarian , that is , to be able to swim quite a long distance comfortably for pleasure and safety . It also serves as a preparation for lifesaving techniques as well as being a " feeder " for varsity competition .

aphb_25100072_1472 This can be gauged from the complete absence of such instruments in contemporary Italian paintings and sculptures . Later on , bowed instruments imported from Germany and France served as models to the Italians with the result that their craft of instrument-making took an upward trend , leading to a unique mastery .   
aphb_40800587_3016 In July 1949 , after the initial success of Dr Erhard's experiment in free-enterprise economics , the party firmly rejected all economic planning and fundamental social reform .

aphb_12502511_825 Worse, some of the townspeople made use of Burial Hill as a quarry whenever they needed a slab for a doorstep or some similar purpose, carrying off the fallen or broken stones heaped up in a corner of the burial ground. And there were some who did not hesitate to pull down standing stones if these seemed to serve their purpose better.   
w7_0598316_1537 And then there are more esoteric items. Richard J. Bertero, a trustee of the California Academy of Sciences, recently gave $25,000 to the academy to fund restoration of the stuffed grizzly bear that in 1952 served as a model for California's current state flag.   
w7_0373411_959 On the positive side, there are now "very few other places to get tax-free cash flow," says Tom Ochsenschlager, a partner in the Washington office of Grant Thornton, an accounting firm. Also, Congress severely restricted the supply of tax-free municipals that don't clearly serve a "public purpose."
w7_0809183_2040 Meanwhile, the boom hasn't made a dent in the huge pool of adults who aren't counted in the labor force because they aren't even looking for work. "If New York's comeback didn't serve as a magnet, under what conceivable circumstances can we see these people coming into the mainstream?" asks Mr. Ehrenhalt of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   
aphb_50403705_3544 This was because " Sulphur Island, " as the Japanese called it, was only 760 miles south of Tokyo. It would serve as an emergency landing point for the big B-29 bombers flying from Marianas bases to Japan.   
aphb_07001025_487 Many have stayed on , and , says the ABA , " There has been a notable improvement in the caliber of justice dispensed . " In fact , the Chicago traffic court now serves as a " teaching court " for judges from other districts .   
aphb_33201136_2041 Desperately he poked his neighbor in the ribs and there began a tussle which caused the bus driver to pull to the side of the road and threaten grave punishment if there was not an end to the goofing around . The set-to had served its purpose for Mike , though , and he entered the school building with his nerves and muscles a little less taut .   
aphb_35900706_2203 A good number of grownups try to bridge the gap between the worlds by translating what children say and in the process changing its meaning entirely. Since what children say is so frequently shocking to respectable adults, these translations serve the comforting purpose of transforming the starkly primitive into the blandly innocuous.   
aphb_19700398_1237 The air supply used is often a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen or helium and oxygen . The rope or " lifeline " serves as a communication link , if no telephone is used , and also as a means of hauling the diver to the surface .

aphb_28002561_1790 Mothers model femininity for daughters and sons. Fathers may serve as models for sons of what a man can be like, and give daughters some feeling of how to relate to a man.   
w7_01514722_366 The real question about greenmail is this: How do we control waste without doing away with the benefits that an aggressive outsider with constructive plans for a company can bring? We should allow greenmail that serves as a management-consulting fee, and that forces entrenched bosses to improve corporate operations.   
aphb_38201301_2720 The weather on our day of departure seemed a happy omen . It was a blue and windy May morning that served as a tonic to everyone's spirits .   
aphb_32800065_2004 Whether or not Germany could have won the war , she was certain to lose it if the gigantic production of American factories reached England in sufficient quantity . On this proposition the lines were drawn for the epic " Battle of the Atlantic , " in which the U-boats served as the vanguards of Germany's defense .   
aphb_17500532_1135 The pressure of the immense weight of a sixteen-thousand-foot depth of ocean water on such a rift may affect it, too. Wherever a fissure opens, the magma from below can ooze up and find its way into subterranean cracks and chambers that will serve as reservoirs.   
w7_03513519_916 I have dared to point out that the rise of ultra-orthodox and right-wing extremists such as Rabbi Kahane and his Jewish Defense League and others may in a large measure be a reaction to the super-liberal activists who have taken over so many of these organizations. Mr. Rothenberg's comments should serve as a warning to those who develop these agendas that there is a substantial segment of Jewish citizens who do not agree with their views.   
aphb_47702616_3372 What is self-fulfillment ? It is that inner glow , that personal gratification , which comes to you when you know that you have done something well and that what you have done has served a useful purpose .

w7_0681168_1768 GRADED ONLY ON THE QUALITY and quantity of its biomedical breakthroughs, the pharmaceutical industry gets a solid A. Graded on its ability to get these wonders to market, however, the industry merits a weak B. In recent years, industry and university scientists "have made the conceptual and technical breakthroughs (in biotechnology) that will serve as the basis for all kinds of new drugs and diagnostics for years to come," says Herbert Weissbach, director of the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology, a research organization funded by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., a major pharmaceutical concern and a unit of Switzerland's F.

w7_010239_241 One of the great achievements of the period after World War II was the codification of the rules for international trade in GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Even though it is honored as much in the breach as in the observance, it still serves as the norm.   
w7_0771335_1983 The bearish performance of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone shares also chilled trading. NT&T has served as a sentiment weather vane for the market lately, portending, according to some observers, whether general share prices can or can't be primed for a rally.

aphb_15700314_988 The most realistic is that Mauro De Mauro , for many years a leading figure in the investigations into Mafia big shots and their activities , had stumbled on an unusually " hot " piece of information . His abduction could have served three purposes : to find out how much he knew of the dangerous truth , to stop him from publishing it and to find out from whom he had learned it .   
aphb_54300046_4376 A giant double-woven (reversible) Ojo, or a number of large Ojos alternating side-by-side, make a lovely, inexpensive room divider. Mounted in a bathroom window, a single Ojo may serve as a colorful shade, allowing sunlight to filter through the weave and cast patterns on the opposite wall.   
w7_02616372_644 NEW DEVELOPMENTS in data processing and sensor technology are making the satellite an increasingly valuable tool for earthbound prospectors seeking clues to mineral deposits. Early survey satellites served commercial geologists mostly as platforms for aerial photography, helping them find faults and fissures in the earth where minerals might occur.   
w7_06318200_1665 Although Federal Reserve officials didn't mention the dollar's recent decline against most major currencies and its negative impact on the bond market, many economists believe the Fed recognizes the close correlation between a sinking dollar and falling bond prices. The Fed's "highly visible" tightening "serves as a counterpunch to the pervasively negative psychology toward the dollar in the foreign exchange markets," said David M. Jones, a senior vice president at Aubrey G. Lanston & Co.   
w7_0144137_333 Betel shops dot India's landscape. They are found in the most remote villages and on almost every block in urban India, where they serve as gossip centers, too.

w7_0059279_104 A federal appeals court in Philadelphia also upheld the law in 1985, and the mine owners appealed. The Supreme Court said its past rulings suggest that a land-use regulation may result in a taking of property if it serves no significant public purpose or if a landowner is denied "economically viable" use of the land.   
aphb_27201615_1596 Consequently the walls and partitions, wood or otherwise, of any house should contain fire stops on at least the floor lines and the roof to seal off any fire that could otherwise travel upward through them. Many types of commercial insulation, when thick enough to fill up the space completely, serve this purpose.   
aphb_26000239_1524 She slipped through a thick tangle at the edge of the abandoned village and was attracted by the rustling of several rats that were working through a kitchen midden , when a more enticing sound caught her attention . Even before she began her stalk on the rats she swung through one of the thatch-roofed pole huts and leaped easily onto a wooden platform that had once served as a bed for an entire Seminole family .   
aphb_52601222_4246 There are passages here and there from which connoisseurs alone can derive satisfaction; but these passages are written in such a way that the less learned cannot fail to be pleased, though without knowing why... Leopold undoubtedly felt that to be regarded in earnest as a " serious " composer, he lacked the most essential quality: the impulse, the divine spark. He knew that at best he could serve as a model only in slight degree; so he sought elsewhere for models.

aphb_38701428_2748 But worst of all , due to the lack of chloroform and ether , the only known anesthetics , hundreds of wounded men went under the knife with nothing except a few swallows of strong whisky to deaden the pain . Surgeons used sharp penknives for scalpels ; tree bark strips served as tourniquets , splinters of soft pine as bullet probes , while fence rails were used for splints and crutches .

w7_07915591_2030 Nicholas Callaway's "Georgia O'Keeffe: 100 Flowers" (Knopf, 118 pages, $100) is the sort of coffee-table book that, laid down horizontally, might actually serve as the top of the table itself.   
w7_03111338_794 In 1969, Taipei literally stank of poverty. A haze of charcoal smoke rose from the buckets that served as stoves for women who did their family cooking on the sidewalk.   
w7_05310863_1389 At that time, the International Maritime Satellite Organization, or Inmarsat, decided it would be more expeditious to choose the shuttle and the Ariane for its next three launches -- even though the Russian bid was lower. "The U.S. stand in relation to the Soviet Proton rocket, which was suggested as a carrier for Inmarsat's ship-to-shore communications network, can serve as a classic example of bias," Stepan Bogodyazh, International Liaison Department chief of Glavkosmos, told a Moscow newspaper.

w7_0693256_1792 A spokesman for the National Association of Insurance Commissioners said the group is examining whether limits should be placed on junk bond investments. If it concludes regulation is needed, the group would draft legislation that would serve as a model for states to consider.   
aphb_28801437_1825 The farther we went , the bigger the farms , the farther apart . Rising up out of the snow were large , prosperous houses and barns , many of them flanked by sturdy groves of cottonwoods , straight , symmetrical rows that served as windbreaks .

aphb_03900157_282 Synchronized with the attack by what we must remember is "coercive persuasion or brainwashing," was the announcement last February by New York University that it now offers a master's degree in sensitivity training; followed by Redlands University in California with its trumpet blast in May that it, too, starts ST this summer and that it will be mandatory! Here a bona fide quotation quite sensible is made to serve as a base for utterly unfounded assertions and a vaguely horrendous innuendo.   
aphb_16602168_1027 The Conference itself would meet seldom, and only to ratify arrangements already worked out in smaller groups or through diplomatic channels. But it could serve as an umbrella for special-purpose conferences among smaller groups of nations on manageable chunks of the European security problem.   
w7_0107012_253 "I can't afford to retire, and even if I could, I'd miss the excitement of my job," says Mildred Tuffield, who at 67 is administrative director of a New York nonprofit firm.

aphb_50001408_3524 Not infrequently there occurs in such phrases a note that might be called a resting note . Coming at the end of a period , it serves as a sort of calm zone between two agitated phrases .   
aphb_28300731_1805 For many religious people, a fantasy of a sex act that, if performed in real life, would be against the individual's moral code is ethically unacceptable. On the other hand, there are those who consider that the fantasied act may substitute for the real act and thus serve as a harmless avenue of release for more violent and antisocial urges.

aphb_18101854_1186 The island , five miles long and a mile wide , with sandy beaches and pine woods , is one of the Iles d'Hyeres . Its moon-shaped bay , dominated by the 16th-century fort of Sainte-Agathe , has long served as a port of refuge .

w7_0537952_1382 And on the opposite side of the same wall is what must be one of the most marvelously designed radios ever built, Walter Darwin Teague's "Bluebird Radio" (1937-40). This consists of a great smoky-blue glass disk, almost large enough to serve as a dressing mirror, onto which has been laid a beautifully proportioned shiny metal grid punctuated by the rhythmic circles of the dial and tuning knobs.   
w7_04612886_1198 If the commission were to find the Merc guilty, it could impose fines and order the Merc to refrain from further violations of this type.

aphb_48204161_3426 Sidney rocks the deck against the polished wood until the cards are perfectly aligned. The gold ring on his little finger seems to serve as a device, a neat little fastening by means of which his hand movements are harnessed and made trim.   
aphb_13500853_889 He heard the Scarecrow fall to the ground with a mushy sound , and then he himself quickly dismounted and looked at his friend Jack .

aphb_30000838_1879 Generations of human beings cowered in the gloom of these caves and looked out with apprehension into the brightness of an outside world teeming with fearsome animals . Any natural rocky crevice served as a shelter and a protection to our practically defenseless ancestors .

aphb_36602123_2253 Some of these journals are dull and pedestrian, but others are lit by vivid description and by wry flashes of humor. Many of them serve as valuable resources to historians, and a few are of use to the student of literature as well.

w7_0162931_376 Nuclear deterrence has kept the peace in Europe -- conventional deterrence can't do the same, short of Soviet unilateral disarmament. Nuclear forces that would remain under the agreement are clearly insufficient to serve as NATO's nuclear deterrent.   
w7_0728399_1877 One of the key objectives of last year's tax reform was to create fairness and neutrality in the tax code, but the new law rewards those with home equity that can be converted into borrowing. Another question is: Has the new tax law served the purpose of discouraging borrowing?   
aphb_19701744_1246 Undersea vehicles would be vitally important to such a mining installation carrying supplies, construction materials, tools, equipment, and men.

w7_04210506_1089 In the videotape presentation that accompanies the photographs, a banker who spent days helping to rescue clients' livestock remembers chicken and dumplings tasted mighty good at the time, but adds "I haven't cared much for them since." In the final picture of the "mule set" Mr. Dameron shows a mass of mules, interspersed with a few horses and hogs, being unloaded at the waterfront, where men in high hip-waders wait to claim their own and help herd them through town to the tobacco warehouses that served as barns.

That Joycean achievement -- an Irish intellectual mandarin's version of cockney rhyming slang, reinvented from the materials of myth, legend, most religions -- could (although it shouldn't) serve as well as the poetry of W.B. Yeats as an introduction to exported Irish literature for the common reader.   
w7_05612021_1466 But the move, disclosed in an unusual news release spelling out the existence of what was supposed to be a secret investigation by the commission's staff, indicates that the agency likely believes such violations are relatively frequent. Jeffrey Zuckerman, director of the FTC's bureau of competition, said in an interview that the announcement was intended to serve as a warning that the agency intends to punish those who fail to comply with the reporting requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust law.   
aphb_52603434_4253 Mozart went farthest along the path of Italianate carefreeness in his Litaniae de venerabili altaris sacramento of March 1772 ( K. 125 ) , in which he took a work by his father as a model and surpassed it . The text actually serves only for private devotions ; but Leopold or Wolfgang nevertheless performed the work , or wished to perform it , in Munich in the Hour Service of New Year's Day , 1775 .

aphb_12001479_775 In any case , America has not really stood between Japan and Communist China , and the incompleteness of the relationship between the two is basically because of Peking's intransigence and Japan's interest in Taiwan . Still , among the general public , Japan's unsatisfactory relationship with Communist China is blamed principally on the United States and serves as a major strain in the relations between the two countries .   
aphb_54902981_4408 Taverns were the way stations for the stagecoaches that were beginning to link the colonies together . There were no hotels , so the upstairs rooms of the grogshop served for the traveler who had to stay overnight to await the next stage .

The Senate resolution must be reconciled with a House-passed plan that calls for an $18 billion tax increase, before it can serve as a guide to future congressional action.

When it had been a pet shop a few years back the laundromat's smeared plate-glass window might have served some useful purpose such as giving the puppies a view of the street .   
w7_03211657_819 Finally, with the passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868 and its extension as a control over the states in our own century, the substantive good often gained by allowing governors discretion in these matters has become less imperative. However, while it is still around, reflection upon Dennison can serve as antidote to two blinding prejudices, pervasive among students and faculty, that I've encountered as a teacher of constitutional law.   
aphb_25102335_1479 Young Quantz lived for seven years with Uncle Justus and his son-in-law , Adam Fleischhack , being trained not only in violin-playing , but also mastering the oboe , trumpet , cornet , and trombone , and studying composition .

aphb_52602074_4250 The final movement is introduced by a kind of darkly heroic cavatina of the first violin and then turns to G major, but it is the disconsolate major that Mozart utilizes in so many of his last works. The theme of this Rondo seems somewhat too trivial to serve as the resolution of the three preceding movements, and creates a slight shock each time it reappears after the " episodes."   
w7_04718465_1227 Adds Howard Sinclair-Jones, executive director of the Ontario Council of Agencies Serving Immigrants, "Canada is shortsighted in assuming only people with money make an economic contribution." But proponents of the new funds say they serve a useful purpose.

They both represent the balance between energy acquired and energy expended, and serve as a reserve store of energy. Fatty tissue provides such an efficient way to store energy that all animals tend to deposit greater or lesser amounts of it within their bodies to serve this vital function.   
aphb_01501504_113 The Select Committee, he had heard, was composed of old China hands, supercargoes who knew the language and customs.

w7_05117952_1336 Through much of the last century, RJR has hired entire families, and provided them with low-cost housing, day care, even band concerts and baseball games. It was RJR, or its founders, who helped give Winston-Salem a center for the arts, influenced Wake Forest University to come to the city and raised a building so striking -- the tobacco company's headquarters built in 1929 -- it served as a model for New York's famed Empire State Building.

aphb_12002143_778 They also account for a good bit of Taiwan's disproportionately large expenditures for its military establishment. The islands thus serve only as an irritant to the Communists and a smoldering fire that might rekindle a broader conflagration.   
aphb_03100746_200 Even after years of marriage, many couples have never developed an understanding of each other's viewpoint, much less a way to resolve the differences.

Fashioned of periwinkle and quahog shells, they seemed merely to serve a decorative purpose and to fall into the class of " gay apparel, " something not to be encouraged even among the Indians.   
w7_0486972_1236 In a May 5, 1986, article, Pravda set forth the doctrinal basis for the Soviet state's continued total control of the media and the subordination of factual reporting to the objectives of the state: "The party considers television, radio, and the press as a powerful instrument of publicity and social control. . . . True to Leninist precepts, the Soviet press serves as a collective propagandist, agitator and organizer of the masses."

aphb_53602057_4334 Many times, as a part of their ceremonies, they placed things in the soil, such as dead animals. These dead animals did serve as natural fertilizers, but in most cases the natural environment was just right for farming, regardless of what the priests did.   
w7_00818581_213 Texas Air has been the subject of criticism for its high debt, but unlike United can compensate for the high carrying costs because it has much lower wage scales. It wasn't immediately clear whether the recapitalization plan also violated certain maximum debt provisions of the company's recent aircraft financing arrangement with Seattle-based Boeing Co., which was designed to serve partly as an anti-takeover measure and involved the issuance of $700 million of notes.
